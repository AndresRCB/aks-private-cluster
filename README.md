# Private AKS Cluster
Opinionated instructions on how to deploy and connect to private AKS clusters.

**IMPORTANT**: The files in this repository are not meant for production; rather, they're simplified for instructional purposes (only one network, sensitive defaults, etc.).

## Using this repo
Follow the instructions and files depending on your preference (although I recommend understanding the `az cli` process before using `terraform`).
- [Deploy using Azure CLI](/cli/)
- [Deploy using Terraform](/terraform/)
